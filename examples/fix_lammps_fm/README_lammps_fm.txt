# Instructions for fix_lammps_fm example #
--------------------------------------

This example demonstrates the use of the mscg fix in LAMMPS.
The input system is a system of 1000 methanol molecules that have each been mapped
to a single, center-of-mass site. 
As with all of the examples, the trajectory is not long enough to contain sufficient 
sampling to produce a converged result.

1) The range files can generated by running the range capability of fix mscg:
./lmp < in.rerun_range
	
2) Run the force matching capability of fix mscg:
./lmp < in.rerun_fm

2) Compare the results with those in the "output" directory.
