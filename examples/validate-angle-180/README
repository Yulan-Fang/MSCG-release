The example is used to validate the handling and fitting of angular interactions.
The system is a single molecule consisting of 3 particles that only interact through a harmonic angle
with spring constant 100.0 kcal/mol rad^2 and an equilibrium angle of 180 degrees.
There are 5,000 frames provided.

3particles.lammpstrj is a lammps trajectory of 3 partilces. 
3particles_dump_ang.txt is a lammps dump of the angle and energy at the angle

The table files are force-matched MD_UP_L1_ang.table with the number specified of in the name of the file.
e.g. 5000.table is the force-matched angle table using 5000 frames of 3particles.lammpstrj
