The example is used to validate the handling and fitting of pair bonded interactions.
The system is a single molecule consisting of 2 particles that only interact through a harmonic bond
with spring constant 500.0 kcal/mol A^2 and an equilibrium distance of 1.0 A.
There are 1,000 frames provided.
The reference forces (that should be produced from fitting) are reference_bond.dat

refernce_bond.dat is a lammps trajectory of 2 partilces.
