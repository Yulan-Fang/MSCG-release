The example is used to validate the handling and fitting of pair non-bonded interactions.
The system is 1000 particles that only interact through shifted-force Lennard-Jones (lj/sf)
interactions (sigma = 1.0, epsilon = 1.0, cutoff = 2.5).
There are 20 frames provided.
The reference forces (that should be produced from fitting) are reference_nb.dat.
