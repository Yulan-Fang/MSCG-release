To compile the MSCGFM package, go to the src/ directory, copy an appropriate Makefile 
template from the Make/ subdirectory, change the library and include paths as necessary 
for your machine, and then run 'make all' to get the executables rangefinder.x
and newfm.x.

This package requires 3 nonstandard libraries: LAPACK, the GNU scientific library 
(GSL v 2.1+), and the Gromacs XTC library. The version of the Gromacs library that the
code was designed using is included in this distribution. The Gromacs features can be
optionally excluded using the "no_gro" targets in the make file. Nonetheless, all 
non-standard libraries available for download free of charge and are easy to find with an 
internet search by name.
