Zack-representability

I) Introduction
	1) Examine common practices in CG modelling 
	2) Discussion of common CG methods
	3) Review of Representability and MS-CODE papers
	4) Goal of this paper (apply representability ideas to observables and techniques used in MARTINI)
	5) Organization of paper
	
II) Theory
	1) Partition Coefficient
	2) Pressure and Surface Tension
	3) Undulation spectrum and bending modulus
	
III) Results
	1) partition coefficient -- numerical (???)
	2) pressure and surface tension -- numerical investigation (in-progress)
	3) undulation spectrum/bending modulus --  numerical investigation (Zack's work)

IV) Conclusions
